# Unleash your creativity.

52 Sketches provide tools to help you unleash your creativity.

Being an artist or an otherwise creative person is a constant challenge. There are forces that conspire to block, hold back, and impede your creativity. We give them various names. Writer's block, ennui, The Resistance. We read about them in _The Artist's Way_ by Julia Cameron, _The War of Art_ by Stephen Pressfield, and _On Writing_ by Steven King.

**52 Sketches** is dedicated to creating tools to do something about it. We create things that help artists and creative people unlock their creativity, generate flow states, create, and live the lives of creative people.

      Every person is different and so is every artist. The art is different, as is the vision of success. But musicians, writers, actors, comedians, and dancers all have a path they took and a practice they maintain. Exploring what works for them can help us all find what works best in our own creative lives.

## EarlyWords

[EarlyWords](https://earlywords.io) is a tool for daily journaling in the style of Morning Pages espoused by Julia Cameron.

Private, stream-of-concious journaling allows us to practice setting the resistance aside and allowing ourselves the freedom to make our thoughts manifest. With this daily practice we banish the inner critic and become freer, more prolific, and more truthful in our work.

## Lightpanel

(Coming soon)

In an ideal world you would have just the right amount of natural light for filming. Barring that, you would have the right studio lights, filters, and diffusers you need to look your best.

We don't live in an ideal world. Sometimes all you have is your computer screen.

Lightpanel turns any computer screen into an adjustable panel light with adjustable color temperature. It's perfect for Zoom meetings, video conferences, or audition self-tapes. Anytime you need a light but only have a computer screen, Lightpanel is here for you.
