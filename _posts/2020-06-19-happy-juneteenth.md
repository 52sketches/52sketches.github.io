On June 19, 1865, enslaved Americans in Galveston, Texas were first informed of the Emancipation Proclamation—the executive order that declared their freedom.

A declaration is never enough. After a declaration of freedom, comes the fight to make it a reality.

That fight is still going on today. Our streets are filled with young and old from every corner of our communities demanding that we dismantle what isn’t working and replace it with something that ensures freedom and equity for everyone, especially those who have been and are being marginalized.

We’re taking today to reflect on our place in the world. How can we best help to dismantle systems of injustice that block others from the wondrous possibilities this life offers?
