Welcome to 52 sketches, a podcast about creativity and creative practices. here's your host, Rob head.

Rob Head  0:16
Welcome to the 52 sketches podcast. We are here to talk about creativity and living a creative life practices and habits, strategies for making wonderful things. Today we are going to speak with multi disciplinary artist Phillip Daniel. Yes, Phillip is an actor, a writer, a singer, songwriter, voiceover actor living and working in Los Angeles. As Philly ocean. He is the front man for yacht rock cover band Yardley crew. And among other things, he is currently writing a feature film. That's right. So well welcome, Phillip.

Phillip Daniel  0:51
How you doing, Robert? Glad to be here.

Rob Head  0:53
I'm doing great. So you know, it's July 2020. As we record this, and the Coronavirus, peppered pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of the work of creative professionals. So I want to start by saying person to person, you know, thank you for taking the time to chat about creativity and check in about how you're how you're feeling? And absolutely, how are you well and happy? And,

Phillip Daniel  1:20
you know, I am I am doing well, thanks for asking. Um, you know, I think honestly, I have to say I feel incredibly grateful. I feel very fortunate. through all of this, as you said, I'm a multi hyphenate. So in addition to my artistic endeavors, I come from a hard working blue collar family. For the last decade, I've had several other little side jobs and businesses and side hustles and whatnot, which is also kind of the norm in particularly in Los Angeles. But I think more and more throughout the country. And so while it has been a tremendous loss, in terms of revenue and income, since we can't play shows, there are no auditions happening for any TV shows, or films really at all right now. And one of my other day jobs was at a restaurant at the legendary Chateau Marmont Hotel in Hollywood. You know, I've basically had three income streams just completely dry up. Right, thank goodness for the, you know, the unemployment, thank goodness for the stimulus. You know, and thank goodness for the occasional person that needs somebody fixed and needs a handyman, because that's also what I do.

Rob Head  2:40
Right? Yeah. Yeah. So there's a, there are a lot of challenges that you just mentioned, and I think a lot of people can relate to that. Have any new doors opened because of these strange times?

Phillip Daniel  2:52
You know, I, I cannot stop thinking about the opportunities that have been present in this, you know, I think I can imagine that you probably, you run a pretty brisk clip in your life, right? Like, you're probably pretty much on the go all the time, my schedule is is normally keeps me on the borderline of completely being overwhelmed. And so I've really actually enjoyed having a little bit less to do now, mind you, that just means that I'm like, still really, really busy. I'm just not like almost breakneck, busy, right. Um, so I've really utilize the extra time that I've had to infuse energy into projects that were getting pushed to the backburner, or I wasn't able to attend to as often as I'd like. You mentioned in the opening that, you know, one of the things I did in the first three weeks of the lockdown in March was I got together with a writing partner. And we finished beating out the outline for a feature that we've been working on for like six months. And that really, for the first three months of this year, because of my schedule, I was unable to do almost any work on and and also last year, too. I mean, it had been like, four months since we had really settled down, I sat down and had a writers meeting. So that was one of the I was like, Oh my gosh, we have this time. Why don't we invest it into this? You know, when you when there's so many things you can't control? Right? I find it really invigorating to focus on that which you can and to put energy in that and to, you know, inspire yourself? Absolutely, that you can do.

Rob Head  4:36
Yeah, you really triggered my memory of reading. Julian Cameron's, what is your right artists, artists way right artist she had, she had two practices. And I think when we talk about this sort of breakneck pace, one of the practices that she mentions, there's the morning pages which are taking time to just sort of stream of consciousness and to your mind and and that's wonderful, but One of the other ones, and you may think of this is the artist has date. And she, she really emphasizes that you have to have time in your life to be able to be creative. And I think one of the things that this sort of global pause has done for us is to realize, wow, maybe I was pushing myself so hard that I couldn't really release everything I had in me before.

Phillip Daniel  5:24
Yeah, when I think when you push your nervous system to the brink of you know, that fight or flight response, you know, and right, when you're kind of living on adrenaline, you know, I think the best creativity, the the best creations come from, really a state of almost surrender and relaxation. Because that's where you're free enough to allow whatever, you know, is most authentic, organic, unedited, you know, uncontrived to emerge, I think, right, right, as an artist, like that's maybe like the most important state you can get yourself into, is that relaxed state where you can actually be receptive to your own creativity or inspiration around you.

Rob Head  6:09
Right? Yeah, that's, I've been thinking about that a lot in the last couple of years. Really. There's another book that you're reminding me of Twyla Tharp is a very famous choreographer. And she has written a couple of books one, I think it's called the creative habit. And another is called the, um, collaborative habit. And in the creative habit, she really talks about the importance of balance of being like, Okay, well, you have to have the discipline in your art, but you also have to have a life and, and relationships and all of these things that, you know, you have to have something to to, you know, speak about drauf right about dance. And so this whole idea of balance is really resonating with me. Yeah, very cool. So let's back up from 2020. And let me you know, what is your backstory? Tell us about your creative upbringing? Did you love to sing or play music? or cook or act? Or Oh, my gosh, yeah, you know, what did you do as a kid?

Phillip Daniel  7:03
What? Yeah, I often when people ask me about this, I respond by saying, if I were to write an autobiography, it would be my life, the cliche, because, you know, I was the only child of a single mom who loved to entertain her love to make her laugh. You know, we went through a lot when I was, you know, zero to 10, we, we just really did not have a lot of money. We moved around a lot, you know, life was not necessarily easy in a lot of ways. Um, you know, and, and my mom is one of the hardest working, tenacious, courageous women I have ever met. And, and she's resilient. But, you know, we went through some stuff. Yeah. And, you know, the role that I kind of assumed was to, you know, make things better to fix, you know, to entertain to, you know, and all that stuff. So, from a very young age, I remember dancing around my favorite song when I was about six or seven was love bomba by Richie Valens. Oh, yeah, had his, I had a vinyl actually a vinyl album of Richie Valens that I used to sing to and put on concerts in the living room, and, you know, and then I would do impressions and I was obsessed with Robin Williams and, and his movies and you know, how vivacious and creative he was and how insane he was, you know, he was incredible. And I just really took after artists like that, and then, you know, but but I never thought anything of it. And then in like middle school, I started doing these skits on the morning announcements with my best friend, which kind of, you know, got us to a certain, I guess, level of popularity, but that wasn't really why we were doing it. We were just because we we were entertaining ourselves really. And clowning. Uh, yeah, we're just climbing. That's it, you know? Yeah. And honestly, the funny thing is, we were actually both we were both officers in the earth club.

Rob Head  9:01
Okay. What is that,

Phillip Daniel  9:02
like, huge nerds? Well, one of the one of the teachers at our middle school had started the earth club, okay. And it was all about, you know, science and preserving the earth in the environment and understanding their natural environment and whatever. And she wanted more students to get involved. So she like, sent us out on a mission to, you know, go on the morning announcements and recall

Rob Head  9:23
I say, yeah, and

Phillip Daniel  9:25
so that's kind of that's kind of how it all began. And then in high school, my first year, we had the option to either write this 20 or 30 page report on Romeo and Juliet as our final project. Or we could do a media project they called it which could include a film a short film, or multimedia presentation. And so a friend of mine, and I got the idea. Well, why don't we recreate? You know, in short, the story of Romeo and Juliet and I ended up playing like seven or eight years. From the play in that, and then after we showed it, and it was like, 20 minutes long after we showed it, my teacher pulled me aside and she's like, have you ever thought about acting? And I was like, What? What's that? Like? I hadn't two and two together. Right? Um, you know, I hadn't even really thought what I was doing was that it was because I was just having fun with my friends. Sure. Yeah. You know, which is actually like kind of a profound, like thing to realize. Because that's really the art that

Rob Head  10:32
goes now. Right? Yeah, exactly. The idea would be you know, you're having fun with your friends. Yeah, you're crazy. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

Phillip Daniel  10:42
Yeah. Right. And I think that's what what most audiences are drawn to, is they want to see that. That's what we find most inspiring and connecting, I think, yeah,

Rob Head  10:53
well, I think about these, like, Saturday Night Live alumni who, who have made a career of making movies with their friends from SNL, right? Yeah. And, as you can see, you can feel the sort of camaraderie in their work, even though so a lot of the movies are silly, or, you know, oh, yeah. Not high art. Yes. But but it's entertaining and, yep. Okay. So you had those early Inklings? How did you get you know, from there? How did you arrive at a professional career? I mean, what inspired you?

Phillip Daniel  11:23
Well, after my high school, English teacher, you know, kind of said, You should go try out for a school play. I did. And I ended up acting in every school play that we had for the rest of my high school career. And, and then from there, I went to an acting conservatory in New York. I studied at the New York School of film and television for a year. Then I moved back out west and started attending Chapman University's film program, because my mom was like, you can't get a degree in theater. She's like, you can act you can do whatever you want. But you just you have to get a degree in something else. So my answer to that was, well get a degree in filmmaking, because that's a whole lot better.

Rob Head  12:04
Right? Yeah. Wait, WordPress. Oh, yeah.

Phillip Daniel  12:08
But my webcam and back then, Chapman is in Orange County. It's about an hour south of Los Angeles. I see. It's right next right next door to Disneyland. And it's a small private college. Well, not so small anymore. But at the time, Chapman was was a, and is still a very prominent film school. It's probably in the top five or 10 film schools in the US, you know, you have UCLA and USC, you have Northwestern, you have NYU. And Chapman's probably like five or six on the list. But it's it's honestly, it's become a really, really phenomenal program. And it was, it was highly immersive. You know, basically, you show up the first semester, and they shove a camera in your hand and was like, go make something. So right. I really liked that. But for the rest of my college career, I basically got away from acting because I was so focused on learning how to produce films and and cinematography that that was my dual major. And, you know, and just, you know, enjoying college life and you know, living like you said, right?

Rob Head  13:16
Yeah, yeah. You say you study production and cinematography.

Phillip Daniel  13:20
Yes, producing and cinematography. Mm hmm. So yeah, cuz I finished, I finished my cinematography credits pretty early, because I was just so hungry to learn about that art. And I had such a respect for it. But then I had like a semester and a half left. And I was like, Well, what else could I do? And I did the math on my credits. And I was like, well, I could, I could actually do a whole other major and complete all of the producing requirements as well.

Rob Head  13:50
Yeah. Did you finish that? Oh,

Phillip Daniel  13:52
yep. Oh, that was an amazing that was intimate. I think I was a part of 26 films. Last last, I counted. I was a part of about 26 different films in my three years at Chapman.

Rob Head  14:06
That's amazing. So you know, I think of

Robert Rodriguez, you know, he, in his 10 minute film school, he talks about, you know, that the the way to get good is to make films. You know, you know, I remember him saying, you've got some bad films in you. So make them now, you know, yeah, absolutely. You can make good films later, you know? Yep. And so I actually was

Phillip Daniel  14:33
watching I'm out. Oh, yeah, it reminds me of something I saw in the history of the Eagles, the documentary about the Eagles. Sure. Um, uh, Glenn Frye was basically an apprentice with Bob Seger back in the day, really. And Yep, back in Detroit they met which is where Glenn fries from. And when he was first learning how to write songs. Glenn said to Bob Seger, you know, what if I write a bad one, and Bob's response was, oh, you you'll write many bad ones. But you just got to keep writing. And eventually you'll get good. Right. And that's true of any art.

Rob Head  15:14
There's no way to skip the bad ones.

Phillip Daniel  15:16
Yeah. No. You have to put in your 10,000 hours.

Rob Head  15:19
That's right. That's right. Yeah.

Wow. Okay. So after Chapman, how did you get from there from your, you know, academic study to, to the point where you were, you know, you're described instead of having many income streams, but you know, where you have some semblance of your professional career where you feel like this is my main gig.

Phillip Daniel  15:41
Well, after I graduated from film school, I was pretty disillusioned. I was pretty over film, and I was, you know, as many students in this country do, I had, you know, almost $90,000 in student loan debt from, you know, going to school for so which

Rob Head  15:57
is psychologically oppressive. It's,

Phillip Daniel  15:59
it's Oh, my God. I love that. Yeah, absolutely. That's 100% accurate. And I kind of just, I didn't realize this at the time, but I kind of just wanted to get away I kind of wanted to run away. So I refer to the next couple of years of my life as my time in the desert. Because I took a job up in Ashland, Oregon, working where we were an author where we met Yeah, and working for several authors, actually, but the reason I kind of landed in Ashland, Oregon was I had been reading books. By Neale Donald Walsch called conversations with God and his organization was based up there and I was interested in kind of connecting with him and, and doing some work with him out there. And so I moved up there. That's what got me to Ashland. Right. And I worked with another guy named James Twyman for a while I worked with the formidable Jean Houston for a while, right. Um, and during this time, up in Ashland, I went through like the the most horrific heartbreak that I've ever experienced in my life. And, as I think many, many heartbreaks do, they kind of have a way of showing you to yourself, and I want my takeaway, my key takeaway after that relationship ended was that I had really nothing to show for my life that I cared about. I had made my whole life about that relationship that was like, and I was like, Oh, my God, this is the only thing that I had, what am I about? What do I want, you know, and a couple of my experiences up there had also really led me to the clarity of like, I, this is not my path. I don't, you know, I'm not interested in being a spiritual author. Although I am a spiritual person. I really thrive in a creative profession. I don't want to sit behind a desk. I don't want to be relegated to an office, I, I really don't even want to be working for somebody else's vision. Right? I have a vision for my own life, and I want to go out and I want to pursue that. And so, you know, I started thinking about what that was. And I remember going to see the Julie Taymor film across the universe.

Rob Head  18:19
Right,

Phillip Daniel  18:20
The Beatles in 2000. And I think this is late 2007 when it came out. And yeah, The Beatles movie, and I was just so in awe. And inspired and moved. And I was like, Yeah, well, that's it dummy. Like, that's it. You know, that's always been it. Um, and you got to stop being afraid of it, you know, that that was the thing that I uncovered was, I was so afraid of that, because I was afraid of failing, I was afraid of being of looking foolish. I was afraid of not being any good, right, of all of these things. And so you know, I think anytime you really say yes to your purpose, you are also saying yes to confronting your deepest fears. And a lot of people don't talk about that. Because most men especially I think maybe this is maybe more true in acting, but I think it's true of all art forms. When you say yes to a, basically you as the product. It is incredibly vulnerable, right? Because right? If I'm, if I'm on a TV show, and even though I'm playing a character named Brad, that's not what is written about in the trades. It's not about if someone doesn't like my performance, they don't go well. You know, that was just Brad, they go No, well, Phillip Daniels sucked in that show. Because that's my face, even though we have the, uh, you know, the suspension of disbelief that that goes away as soon as the show's over. Like, I didn't really buy that, you know, I didn't think There was a compelling performance or I thought that was this was forced or whatever the case may be. So it's very vulnerable. And you have got to a lot of work on yourself on your fears, on your limiting thoughts and beliefs and all that stuff. And I really, very rarely hear any professional artist talk about that. There's a lot of talk about the craft, which is 100%. necessary, right? That's your tool, that's your tool chest, you have to work on your craft instrument, and you have to work on that. But a part of you accessing your craft is getting past and through your fears. And I that's the part that I think that a lot of people miss they if you are not actively growing as a human being uncovering the trauma that you have from your past, and spoiler alert, we all have trauma.

Rob Head  20:49
Yeah. Um,

Phillip Daniel  20:50
and, and understanding your point of view, as a human being, and all the experiences that have shaped that, how can you expect to understand a character's point of view and experiences if you're not doing that work? Right.

Rob Head  21:06
So, yeah, it's, it's the richness of our own lives that enables us to, to bring that response to a character. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yep. So, you know, one of my memories of when you were living in Ashland is the the you're going away party, actually, when you're headed back out to LA? Uh huh. And I remember having this conversation with you, you were inspired, you were like, on fire ready to go back and do whatever it you know, yeah, token, and I remember, we had a similar conversation where you were saying, you know, part of me is afraid, you know, because I'm putting myself out there doing the thing that I love to do. And, and I remember having that discussion and saying, you know, like, Well, what does failure mean? You know, what is the nature of failure, like, if you're doing your purpose, and it's been so inspiring, watching, you know, all the things that you've done, and the years that have a lot since then being like, wow, just grab the tiger by the tail or whatever, they, whatever they call it?

Phillip Daniel  22:03
Well, honestly, I think I would have answered that question differently back then. You know, I don't know that I would have had the same answer to what is failure mean? You know, you know, thankfully, I've been surrounded by a lot of really supportive encouraging people and ideas. And I, you know, I've been hungry to kind of uncover, you know, what's, what goes on inside? And what, you know, what, what is failure? You know, I think it was, I think it was Steve Jobs, who said, if you want to be successful, double your failure rate. And I read that a couple of years in to being down in LA, you know, and really, if you look at any successful person in any industry, you know, they are, they are going out there and trying to fail, because, honestly, failure is where you learn the most, right? If you if you set your ego aside, if you should, if you try not to take the failure personally, but look at it as a learning experience. That's really where you have the most benefit.

Rob Head  23:11
Absolutely, yeah, that really resonates with me, I want to talk a little bit about you've got so you've, you know, you've been on some TV shows, you've got a band, yeah, you've got you've got a lot of things going you've written for, you know, videos that have gone viral and you've done all these things. So, tell us a little bit about your, your daily practices, how do you how do you care for you know, I always refer to it as your instrument, you know, your, your, yourself, you know, how do you care for your, for your, your, your artists, you know, are the things that you do to keep your career moving forward to keep your skills tight to, you know, to hone your craft.

Phillip Daniel  23:49
I have a diverse number of interests. I mean, I, I love to write, I love to perform, I love to break down a scene. I actually really enjoy coaching actor friends, on their scenes in their auditions. I love learning new things I love you know, reading or listening to audiobooks. I love you know, watching TV, I love building stuff. So I would say if anything, my my most consistent practice is staying active. Hmm, I, you know, I'm always moving in some way or another, I always have another project, whether it be building a shelf for my house, or a new music video for the band, or a feature script, or recording a song for you know, with a producer friend of mine, you know, or working on my truck or whatever, you know, like, or learning how to write a couple years ago, I was like, you know, about three or four years ago, I'm like, you know what, every year I want to learn a new skill or do something I've never done before. Okay, and so The first year I went out I got a motorcycle license because I was wanting to do that. And right. Um, you know, and that kind of like, it kind of summarized a little bit of my philosophy. I'm not a, I'm not, you know, someone who's like, addicted to adrenaline. Okay, but I'm I do enjoy pushing through fear. And you know, there's like, there's like this experience of life that's like, just past the threshold of fear. Uh huh. You know, that's different, right? Then just the comfortable experience of life. Sure. And so, um, you know, but I also like to do things in style. So I went out and I got a 65 BMW or 52. And, you know, and, and that's great, because it's not a, it's a classic. It's a classic. It's a rare classic motorcycle, and increasingly more rare, but it doesn't go that fast. It's just a nice cruiser. And,

Rob Head  25:59
you know, it's a land of motorcycles. So callus is the perfect place to to ride around.

Phillip Daniel  26:06
It is, especially now, honestly, it can be a little nerve wracking. I really don't like riding on traffic very much. And it's not a commuter bike. It's it's a, you know, a recreational bike for me. But, um, but I'll tell you, since the lockdown and the pandemic, there has never been a better time to have a motorcycle in Los Angeles, because you can you just get out and you don't have to worry. As much You do have to worry because people be crazy.

Rob Head  26:33
Yeah. But yeah,

Phillip Daniel  26:34
you have to stay vigilant. Always. That's kind of part of the fun in a way.

And, you know, but you can get out there and you can, you know, do your thing. And it's really wonderful.

Rob Head  26:44
Yeah. So you know, one of the things that you said, the fact that you see, building a shelf and writing a script, in the same vein really resonates with me, because I think anytime we're, you know, bringing something into being, it's creative work. And if we do it with a spirit of exploration, and a spirit of I'm adding something beautiful to the world, or I'm fixing something, or I'm serving somebody in some way, whether that's literally a creative art, or, you know, building a shelf. It's a similar process. And there's a there's a connection there that I resonate with. And I really appreciate you, you bring those two things together. Let's talk a little bit about your your current project. So what are you currently working on? You know, do you have something you want to pitch to us that what you're what you're working on right now?

Phillip Daniel  27:35
Well, right now, I'd say that creatively the biggest creative outlet right now is my band Yardley crew. Obviously, we haven't been able to play any shows since March. But we have stayed really active with putting out videos covering songs that we have never done before.

Rob Head  27:53
We've got some really fantastic Yeah, like news coverage. Yeah,

Phillip Daniel  27:56
yeah, we have. So one of the songs that I've always wanted to add to our setlist which we just never have is just the way you are by Billy Joel, old old fan of Billy Joel, love him love his work, right. So I pitched it to the guys a couple of months ago when we were talking about what songs we want to do. And everyone was like, yeah, that's cool. Let's do it. And we had, we had basically just been recording a couple of videos prior to that where we're all taping ourselves in our home studio. And you know, it was fine. It was good. We wanted to put stuff out we wanted there's

Rob Head  28:30
a lot going on right now. Yeah.

Phillip Daniel  28:32
But visually, it really starts to lack, you know, interest. It's like, okay, we've seen this before. Right.

Rob Head  28:40
Right, exactly. We've seen a lot of this in the last two months. Yeah.

Phillip Daniel  28:43
Yeah. And so we really, you know, I was talking with the guys and we were like, Yeah, let's do something different. I was like, Well, what about what if I went out and I filmed at, you know, if I filmed these, like landmarks in Los Angeles, I mean, no one is out right now. Well, one, and this was back in April. And as you know, nobody's out on the town right now because so much, you know, of it was we were in like full lockdown. You know, now, no one seems to care anymore. But, you know, back then, a couple months ago, people were like, yeah, we're actually taking this seriously, like we should be, and staying inside. And so what we ended up doing for that song was going around to iconic la landmarks with each band member. By the way, we were socially distant wearing masks the whole time. We were able to make this incredible video that showcased LA, and we kind of made it as a love letter to the city. I mean, I've lived in LA for 12 years. It's home. Love it here. It's a very, very special place. It gets a bad rap. But honestly, if you've spent any amount of time in LA and you've really learned the history and the lay of the land and the neighborhoods it's impossible to not fall in love with this place. I mean, like any place it has its problems right but right. It's an agreement. A really special place.

Rob Head  30:01
It really is I was so, you know, one of the things that really touched me was the shot you have you in front of the front of Disney Hall, which is a spectacular piece of architecture and such an iconic LA and, you know, means a lot to me. You know, LA is such a fabulous set of incongruous ideas, you know, sort of all wrapped into one I Oh, yeah, I absolutely love it. I find it my favorite city. But it's also in some ways, you know, phantasmagoria it's horrific in, in so many ways, but it's also so beautiful and so full of life and every kind of humanity. Yes, in every kind of creative expression, which is, which is you know, why people have gone for so many generations now? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So yeah.

You know, we made it we wanted, you know, and especially in a time, like where we all find ourselves collectively in. We just wanted to inspire people, we wanted to give people some hope we wanted to remind them of something good. And, you know, that's really what it was about. And I think that's what all my art is about. Really, you know.

Phillip Daniel  32:42
Yeah, I would just say to anyone listening who is considering any pursuit of their art, go for it. Do it on a bash Utley unapologetically, you don't need anybody else's approval. And when you are 80, or 90 or 110, on your deathbed, looking back, you can look back on a life where you gave what you came into this life to give, which is something that no one else can do. And you owe it to yourself and you owe it to the world, frankly, to dedicate your life to giving what literally no other person can to creating what no one else can you have a unique perspective and work through whatever fears, whatever limitations you think you might have, and I promise you do. work through them. So that so that the world can benefit and so that you can live an extraordinary life.
