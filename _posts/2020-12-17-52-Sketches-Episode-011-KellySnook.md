Music Producer and technologist Kelly Snook discusses
growing up as a musician,
becoming a rocket scientist while being a musician,
what does it mean to be a musician,
how Imogen Heap lured her away from NASA,
how music created Kepler's three laws of motion and launched modern astronomy,
using music as a tool to understand ourselves and the universe,
leaving NASA to become a musician, and
data sonification.
