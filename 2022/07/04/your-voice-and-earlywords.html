    <p>EarlyWords invites you to write to yourself once a day.  This exercise can help you resist the influence of social media and advertising. In today’s world, it can be easy to get caught up in the constant stream of information and advertising that is bombarding us from all sides. Social media and advertising are designed to capture our attention and manipulate our behavior, often leading us to make choices that are not in our best interests.</p>

<p>But by focusing on our own ideas, once a day, we can gain a greater awareness of our own thoughts, feelings, and desires. This can help us to resist the influence of social media and advertising, and instead make choices that align with our own values and goals.</p>

<p>For example, when we are scrolling through our social media feeds, we may come across advertisements for products or services that we don’t really need. By listening to our own voices, we can recognize when we are being influenced by these ads and can resist the temptation to make a purchase. Instead, we can focus on what we truly value and need, and make choices that are more in line with our own interests.</p>

<p>In addition, connecting to our inner voice can also help us to resist the pressure to conform to certain standards or expectations that are promoted by social media and advertising. We may feel like we need to look a certain way, or have certain possessions, in order to be happy and successful. But when we listen to our own voices, we can recognize these pressures for what they are and resist the temptation to conform to them. Instead, we can focus on being true to ourselves and making choices that are authentic and genuine.</p>

<p>Introspection can help us to resist the influence of social media and advertising. It can give us the awareness and confidence we need to make choices that are in line with our own values and goals, rather than being swayed by external influences. By taking the time to listen to our own voices, we can gain greater control over our lives and the decisions we make. Join us on <a href="https://earlywords.io/">EarlyWords</a> and listen to yourself.</p>
